# OO War Game

Classic game of war implemented in object oriented python.

It's a buggy mess, and does not work as it should. But the intent was not to create the game that works perfectly, but to show how one could implement a card game using object oriented principals.

### Installation:

First, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Thank me later. While this project does not require much of poetry's advanced features, I like it better and am personally done messing with the headache that is python package managment. So I choose to use it in all of my projects.

Next run `poetry install`

Finally from the root of the repo run `poetry run python war_game/main.py` to see it in action.
